*NOTE:* This file is a template that you can use to create the README for your project. The *TODO* comments below will highlight the information you should be sure to include.


# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project leverages the familiar bank marketing dataset and Azure AutoML to train machine learning models. The model with the most accuracy is then deployed as an endpoint as an Azure Container Instance. Through this Azure Container Instance, an authenticated REST endpoint is used to access the model with an API documented via Swagger. 

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.

1. Make sure our dataset is registered in ML Studio. ![Image of Registered Dataset](./screenshots/registered_dataset.PNG)

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
